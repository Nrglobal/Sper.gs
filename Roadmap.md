Roadmap
=======

In no particular order

##Important
* Live message updates (ideally using websockets with a long poll fallback) - needs to be fixed 
* Links.php needs pagination 
* A script to launch the sphinx daemon 
* <del>users.php token count is inaccurate.</del> 
* <del>invites cant be bought but you can actually use them, possibly add more store options.</del>
* More accurate fallback search 
* diff for message edits is message.php 
* change website theme 
* private messages 
* Anonymous board (Enabeld/disabled by default) - Sort of exists, anonymous posting still shows avatar and signature. Quoting anon posts reveals users identity. 
* archive topics based on certain criteria. 
* <del>add upload box to quick post.</del> 
* <del>postmsg.php is horribly unorganized and should probably be rewritten to make it easier to edit.</del> YAY!
* <del>Some sort of image map functionality</del>
    * I am thinking this could be used to tag and index images which could then be searched. 
* <del>Topical Tags for both Links and topics</del>
    * <del>For topics</del>
* In app updates 


##Site Management Options 
* Suspend People 
* Add a plea topic for banned people 
* Lock topics 
* "delete" <del>messages</del> and links (should still be kept for reviewing purposes) 
* Create users 
* <del>Turn on/off invites</del>
* private boards 
* <del>Set site name.</del>
* Create and manage tags
* Moderator tags that can be posted by anyone but only mods can see. 

##Would be nice
