Roadmap
=======

In no particular order

##Important
* Live message updates (ideally using websockets with a long poll fallback) 
* Links.php needs pagination 
* A script to launch the sphinx daemon 
* users.php token count is inaccurate. 
* invites cant be bought but you can actually use them, possibly add more store options. 
* More accurate fallback search 
* diff for message edits is message.php 
* change website theme 
* private messages 
* Anonymous board (Enabeld/disabled by default) 
* archive topics based on certain credential. 
* add upload box to quick post. 
* postmsg.php is horribly unorganized and should probably be rewritten to make it easier to edit. 
* Some sort of image map functionality, I am thinking this could be used to tag and index images which could then be searched. 
* In app updates 


##Site Management Options 
* Suspend People 
* Add a plea topic for banned people 
* Lock topics 
* "delete" messages and links (should still be kept for reviewing purposes) 
* Create users 
* Turn on/off invites 
* private boards 
* Set site name. 

##Would be nice 
Plugin Interface.
